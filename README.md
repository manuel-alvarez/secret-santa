# secret-santa

You can see a fully functional version here: https://escriva-secret-santa.herokuapp.com/secret-santa/

## Instalation

To test it locally, first you need to have Python 3.6 and pip installed in your computer. We recomend to use VirtualEnv too. It's very useful to avoid install all libraries in the main environment.

Then, install all dependencies with

```
pip3 install -r requirements
```

Once installed, you can run the project with

```
python manage.py runserver
```
